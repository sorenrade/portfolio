  Programming clicked for me in my sophomore year of high school. A friend
showed me how to create a loop in TI-BASIC, and all of a sudden, I felt like
I could make my calculator do anything. I went home and stayed up till 2 am,
hunched over my TI-84, building a ballistic target practice game inspired by
Angry Birds. A few months later, I picked up Python so I could make a game
in Blender. I wrote Python for years. I built overly ambitious games, overly
ambitious UI toolkits, code to do my homework, code to scrape Wikipedia, to
simulate natural selection, and to make art. I was obsessed. I already had a
plan to go to school for mechanical engineering, and I stuck with it because I
thought my programming obsession was a fad. Halfway through college, I realized
it wasn’t; I just wanted to build systems without the hassle of real-world
constraints. So, I picked up a computer science minor and finished my ME
degree anyway.

  In 2019, a portion of [Jonathan Blow’s talk “Preventing the
Collapse of Civilization”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk&t=1345s)
changed my perspective on software engineering. Our standards for software
are incredibly low. We abide slow boot times, lag, and endless minor bugs. I
knew it didn't have to be this way. I was working as a mechanical engineer at
the time, an established discipline with high standards for reliability. Cars
start every time you go for a drive, and bridges don't collapse, but every
time I use a computer, something stumbles. Sure, it's never life-threatening,
but it brings that beautiful feeling of tool embodiment to a halt; one moment
you are dancing, the next your leg falls off. In short, it's annoying.

  I had been playing with Rust for a year, but in light of that realization, Rust’s
extreme pedantry became a godsend. Maybe, it could save me from producing years
of middling, software-grade software. Maybe I could produce mechanical-grade
software.

  Working at [Airhart](https://airhartaero.com) provides an excellent
opportunity to practice writing high-reliability, low-latency software. I've
been lucky to have the freedom to experiment a lot, and it's paid dividends in
knowledge. I built most of our software stack in Rust – about a dozen embedded
processes and tools. The language isn’t perfect by any means, but I am writing
mechanical-grade software. We haven't had a single fault in the air, tools boot
instantly, and processes always behave. It feels like flying.
