    A generalist engineer specializing in hard tech startups.
    I have a strong background in **high-performance software for embedded Linux** and **mechanical design for prototyping**.
    I worked at [Carbon](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/carbon3d) for 9 years, during which the team grew from 10 to over 400. There, I designed and built cutting-edge large-format additive manufacturing technologies.
    I joined [Airhart](https://www.airhartaero.com/) as the first employee. The company never grew to more than 6 people, so I was involved in all aspects of the company strategy, marketing, fundraising, etc. Engineering contributions consisted of both hardware and software development for our autonomous control system, which was installed in a 4-seat aircraft. The CEO and I completed a cross-country flight in the aircraft in February 2025.
